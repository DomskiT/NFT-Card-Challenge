## My process
This is my first project written using my own code. No tutorial or code-along.  
The project met a few brick walls, resulting in a re-write before completion. It's been a fantastic learning experience. 

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox/Grid. Box Model Manipulation
- Love, sweat, tears and Google. 


### What I learned
- Solidify HTMl and CSS basics 
- Focus on a workflow. Example Workflow: HTML > Style Components > layout. Not following a workflow can result in some serious spaghetti.
- It's okay to hit a brick wall, take a breather and come back with a fresh face. 
- You don't know what you don't know. Spend time learning, trying, doing, and finally googling.  

### Continued development in future projects:
- Complex CSS layouts and less reliance on margin/padding for making small adjustments to elements. 
- Working with a project that incorporates Javascript. 
- Better use of Semantic HTML tags.
